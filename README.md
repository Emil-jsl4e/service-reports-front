# Getting Started with Create React App

Hi is the frontend of the site management application.
Which communicates with the backend via HTTP. 
For queries (add, download, update, delete) it uses the axios library.
Currently, it has a login, user, registration, spare parts module.
In the future, I want to add about adding repair orders, reporting work done.
This shows my actual React and typescript programming skills.
